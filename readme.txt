Full Sail Instructions:

"Your README file should explain the installation process in addition to the location of your SQL Dumps and any relevant user / admin user login information needed to test the application.

    MINIMALLY you should have a commit for every pivotal tracker item. The commit text can (best practices, should) be identical to the pivotal text.

    Push to Github on every commit.

    Create an annotated tag for Wednesday turn ins. This annotation should reflect the week’s version number (v2.1, v3.1, v4.1).

        Terminal Command: git tag -a v2.1 -m ‘2.1 Turn in for Review'

        These tags need pushed to Github separately.

            Terminal Command: git push origin --tags

        This tagging works extremely well with github for versioning, which allows you to continue developing while allowing your reviewer to work through your code uninterrupted with you potentially breaking or editing things.

    SQL Dumps should be made and placed in an assets folder for your reviewers.

        Any special instructions a reviewer will need to work with your project (login, db info, etc) should be in your readme file."
