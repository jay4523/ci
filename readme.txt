How to Install:

In order to make the app fully functional, you must download the entire ci folder from Github.
Place the ci folder into your hcdocs folder within MAMP (or equivilant). In the ci folder, you
will find a an sql file (ci.sql). Take this file and upload it to your phpadmin. After you
are done, typing "http://localhost:8888/ci/" into your browser should bring the app up. 

You can then click "register" and sign up for an account, or you can simply use "user" and
"password" as login information. Enjoy.





Notes:

Assets are within the ci folder and labeled "assets"
